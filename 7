#but that's only the begging in matters of string manipulation
#concatenation can be done with strings too

var1 = 'i like'
print(var1)

#shows i like

var1 = var1 + ' feet'
print(var1)

#shows i like feet

#even though i printed the same variable but in different times
#the first time it only carried the string i like, the second time it carried the variable itself plus the string feet
#that means that a variable is truly variable :) it doesnt stay the same forever

var1 = var1 + ' and ' + '.' * 10 + ' toes'
print(var1)

#shows i like feet and .......... toes
#so i can even multiply letters, in this case the character dot
