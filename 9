#now we reached data entry, input. its not that hard, the structure is just like print
#but now we add the variable value by ourselves

age = input('how old are you? ')
print('damn... i mean, ok, youre {}'.format(age))

#if we input 30, shows damn... i mean, ok, youre 30
#but theres a problem, we only get string inputs, but we can convert into another variable
#just put the variable type before the input and put the input in parentheses to isolate him (how many puts is that)

grade = int(input('what was your grade in mathematics? '))
print('only',grade,'?')

#if we input 60, shows only 60 ?
