word = 'sure'
print('my favourite word is:',word,)

#shows my favourite word is: sure

#that's a example of a string variable
#not really incredible, but one thing the got me excited is that every character of the variable
#can be brought by your will, so my favourite character of the word sure is the 's'
#so i only call the first character, it's the 0 (because its the first number)

print(word[0])

#shows s

#but im felling a little 'u' and 'r' fav today, so i bring the second and third character, it's the 1 and 2
#but to get only those, i need to slice the variable string between 1 and 3
#because s=0, u=1, r=2, e=3, so it starts at 1 and stops before 3, so

print(word[1:3])

#shows ur
