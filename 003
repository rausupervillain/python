#for more arithmetic operations use: +, -, *, /, //

print(2-3)

#shows -1

print(3*4)

#shows 12
#and the difference between / and // are that / print the fraction part and // prints just the integer part
#they also can be called as division (/) and floor division (//)

print(10/3)

#this shows 3.3333333333333335

print(10//3)

#and this shows only 3

#there's also % and **
#what they do is modulus and exponentiation

print(10%4)

#shows 2, because it only prints what remains of the division (i am really curious about when im gonna use this)

print(2**4)

#shows 16, because means 2*2*2*2

#the order matters in code too, so remeber "pemdas"
