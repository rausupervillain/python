#variables can be numbers or text

grade= 100
subject = 'mathematics'

print('your grade is:',grade,'on',subject,)

#shows your grade is: 100 on mathematics

#for some reason, you can't begin a variable name with a number, only in the middle or the end
#so 1grade doesnt work, but gr4de and grad33333333333 does

#underline is the only special character accepted by the code to be the name of the variable
#so !subject doesnt work, but _s_u_b_j_e_c_t_ does
