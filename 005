a = 4
b = 6

#== means equality, so when the variable abequal checks if a and b are equal, which is not true, it prints False

abequal = a == b
print(abequal)

#shows False
#but != means different, so the variable abdiff checks if a and b are different, which they are, so it prints True

abdiff = a != b
print(abdiff)

#shows True
