#apparently, pyhton community doesn't like when you use quotation mark instead of apostrophe,
#and i kinda agree. dispite this, both got the work done.

#without the apostrophe the code print doesn't work, only if i wanted to create a arithmetic operation

print(2+2)

#this will print 4

print('2+2')

#but this will print 2+2 because it understand it's a text

print('2'+'2')

#and this will print 22, because the plus sign unite both texts, it's called concatenation
